## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), where my research focuses on Medical Image Analysis and Brain AI. Prior to joining UTA, I worked as an AI Algorithm Engineer at the Tencent & Canway Joint Development Team. I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Tianjin University of Commerce in 2023. I am passionate about leveraging deep learning to advance our understanding of the brain and improve clinical diagnostics. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaboration or have any questions about my research.
